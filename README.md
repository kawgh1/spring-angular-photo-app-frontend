### VineyardFrontend

This project was based on a course by "Get Arrays - Software Development Teaching Platform"
https://www.udemy.com/course/building-a-restful-api-application-using-spring-and-angular/

This was a great project. I did not add much, but it did require quite a bit of troubleshooting.

#### Things I learned about:

- Intro to Spring Security
- Java Mail API for sending pre-formed automated e-mails based on a user action (ex. new user registration)
- JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication and Authorization with Java, SpringBoot + Angular
- HttpInterceptors
- Web Caching
- Google Maps API
- Angular Resolvers (https://codeburst.io/understanding-resolvers-in-angular-736e9db71267)
- General web UX tips

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.4.

#### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
