### VineyardFrontend

This project was based on a course by "Get Arrays - Software Development Teaching Platform"
https://www.udemy.com/course/building-a-restful-api-application-using-spring-and-angular/

This was a great project. A lot of troubleshooting was required throughout the project as well as the
deployment. I did all of the Heroku deployment including rewriting the backend Java code to connect to Amazon S3 storage to host user uploaded images (which Heroku does not support on their servers). 
I added some mobile formatting, UX improvements and other code fixes.

#### Things I learned about:

- Spring Security
- Amazon S3 storage hosting and connection
- Java Mail API for sending pre-formed automated e-mails based on a user action (ex. new user registration)
- JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication and Authorization with Java, SpringBoot + Angular
- HttpInterceptors
- Web Caching
- Google Maps API
- Angular Resolvers (https://codeburst.io/understanding-resolvers-in-angular-736e9db71267)
- General web UX tips
